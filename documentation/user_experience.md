# Stories of You - User Experience Documentation

## Executive Summary

Stories of You transforms the act of recording family memories from a daunting task into a simple, emotionally rewarding experience. By removing technical barriers and providing gentle guidance, we enable families to preserve authentic voices and stories that would otherwise be lost to time. The platform uses a family subscription model where one person manages billing while up to 4 family storytellers enjoy a clean, simple recording experience.

## Core User Problem

**The Memory Preservation Paradox:** Families desperately want to preserve their elders' stories, but traditional methods fail:
- **Writing memoirs** - Too time-consuming and loses the speaker's voice
- **Video recording** - Technically intimidating and overly formal
- **Casual conversations** - Never get recorded or organized
- **Professional services** - Expensive ($500-5000) and feel impersonal
- **Digital complexity** - Elders frustrated by passwords, settings, and tech barriers

**Result:** 87% of family stories are never preserved, and when elders pass, their voices and perspectives are lost forever.

## Business Model

### Family Subscription Plan
- **Price:** $49/year
- **Includes:** Up to 4 storytellers
- **Account Structure:** 
  - 1 Account Holder (manages billing and invitations)
  - Up to 4 Storytellers (record and share stories)
  - Unlimited family viewers (receive share links)
- **Value Proposition:** Less than $1/week to preserve priceless family memories

## Conclusion

Stories of You succeeds by removing every possible barrier between families and their desire to preserve memories. By separating billing complexity from the storytelling experience, we enable adult children to give their parents the gift of legacy preservation without burdening them with technology. The radical simplicity of the storyteller interface, combined with the emotional resonance of voice recordings, creates a product that families don't just use—they treasure.

The $49/year price point makes this accessible to millions of families, while the viral nature of family sharing drives organic growth. Most importantly, we're solving a universal problem: the regret of not capturing our elders' voices before it's too late.
